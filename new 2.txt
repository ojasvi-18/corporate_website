perfect. let's commit this.


you understood what i did?
yess

basically, PortalActions has the info on which url is available to which kind of user. so, i needed to make changes there as well, as well as
the side panel item. Otherwise, that item would nit have been visible on the ui.


Please go to harsh sir, and ask huim to help you commit this change.
After that, write an email to harsh sir, keeping Shikha in CC to put a build on corporate website.

go go go!!
